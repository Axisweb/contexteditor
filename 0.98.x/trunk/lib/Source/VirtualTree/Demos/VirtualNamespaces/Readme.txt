

Read the tutorial in the Doc/VirtualNamespaces folder to understand what VirtualNamespaces are

In order for these demos (and any projects that you want VNSs in) to work you must use a global

{$DEFINE VIRTUALNAMESPACES} conditional define 

for the VSTools packages and recompile. 

If you may also uncomment out this define in the VSToolsAddIns.inc file in the /Include folder.
